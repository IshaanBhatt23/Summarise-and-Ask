# Summarise-and-Ask
• Developed a local web application using Gradio that provides two key functionalities: text summarization and question-answering.
• Implemented a text summarization module and a question-answering system powered by Gemini API for dynamic responses based on user queries.
• Integrated the backend Python functions into an interactive Gradio interface with separate tabs for each feature.
• Utilized libraries and tools including Gradio, Google Generative AI (Gemini), and Python standard libraries (such as open, exec) for dynamic code execution and API management.
• Designed the system to securely load API keys and ensure a seamless user experience with real-time interaction.
